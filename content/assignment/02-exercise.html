<h2>Task 1: Reflection</h2>
<p>Write your reflection for the dayâ€™s readings.</p>
</div>
<div id="task-2-crap-critique" class="section level2">
<h2>Task 2: CRAP critique</h2>
<p>Critique the design of the poster for the BYU Student Wellness Center workshop below. Go through the CRAP checklist and analyze how well or poorly the poster follows each of the principles. Discuss how the posterâ€™s adherence to (or non-adherence to) these principles influences its effectiveness.</p>
<p>(<em>This would have been some random poster from GSU, but I havenâ€™t been on campus since mid-March</em> ðŸ˜­)</p>

<h2>Task 3: CRAP redesign</h2>
<p>Redesign the poster for the BYU Student Wellness Center workshop. Use whatever program you wantâ€”even PowerPoint if youâ€™re most comfortable with that, though itâ€™ll probably be easier to use something like <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> or Adobe Illustrator. If you use Canva, donâ€™t use any of the built-in templatesâ€”start from scratch with a blank page.</p>
<p>To save you from retyping everything, Iâ€™ve included all the text and Student Wellness hex logo in the zip file below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/projects/02-exercise.zip"><i class="fas fa-file-archive"></i> <code>02-exercise.zip</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I didnâ€™t include the Instagram logo. If you want to use that, go find one online. You donâ€™t have to use it. You donâ€™t have to use the big paragraph of text eitherâ€”you can rewrite it to shrink it down if you want.</p>
<p>Critique your new design using the CRAP checklist. How did you use contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity in your improved design?</p>

<h2>Turning everything in</h2>
<p>You donâ€™t need to worry about using R Markdown for this assignment (unless you really want to). On iCollege, submit a PDF of your new poster, along with a PDF of your reflection and your critiques of the original poster and your new poster.</p>
